Provide an "undo" feature

There needs to be significantly different scoring after the first time you guess the shot, and the second time you guess it. It may be that the first time you don't even count and you only start scoring until you get to the second time that shot happens to be selected

The triangle that is drawn from the flipper to the shot is wide at the flipper, but converges to a point at the shot. it should instead not converge, but connect to the buttom end corners of the shot

Add an ability to make a shot "not possible anymore", maybe something like after hitting a shot X times, it becomes not possible, but on some randomness after that in a range of shots?
