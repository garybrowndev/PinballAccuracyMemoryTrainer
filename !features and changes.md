Provide an "undo" feature

There needs to be significantly different scoring after the first time you guess the shot, and the second time you guess it. It may be that the first time you don't even count and you only start scoring until you get to the second time that shot happens to be selected

Add an ability to make a shot "not possible anymore", maybe something like after hitting a shot X times, it becomes not possible, but on some randomness after that in a range of shots?

Go back through all the git history that has a "non-message" and analyuze the patch and see what the difference is then write a commit message and update the log message for that commit revision

Change the color of the result line of flipper to shot after guess as the same color as the error, so green for good, yellow then red for bad

I want release built for every push to github origin master
